# vehicle-management
Solution that validates and handles statetransitions for an abstract vehicle. Valid transitions are defined by various business rules (details below) which are continuously evolving. Some state changes can only be achieved by certain user roles.

# Technical requirements

 1. If the state transition is not valid, the function should return a descriptive error.
 2. If the state transition is valid, the function should return a nil error.
 3. The library needs to have a reasonable performance to be used in a soft realtime API solution.
 4. The solution should include the git history.
 5. The solution must be stateless. Assume that any required state will be provided to the library.

# User roles
